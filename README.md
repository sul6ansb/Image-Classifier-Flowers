Udacity Project:

# Image-Classifier-Flowers

In thisnproject I trained an image classifier to recognize 102 species of flowers using Pytorch.

I used a VGG19cpretrained module to inhance my training quality and speed.

The module was then tested on different flowers test sets, I achieved an accuracy of 86% which is considered to be ver high especially when having 102 different classes.
